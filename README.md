# RSYNC for VMware ESXi



[Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is a lightweight, proven tool for reliable file replication, migration, and backup. It is also a staple on Linux systems, but sadly VMware never included it with ESXi, perhaps favoring commercial backup solutions.

This project restores essential Linux functionality on VMware ESXi by providing a fully static and portable rsync build, enabling reliable host-to-host and datastore-to-datastore file replication.

## **Prebuilt Rsync Binaries:**

If you dont wan't to build your own, download here:
* Latest version: [rsync v3.4.1 for ESXi](https://github.com/itiligent/RSYNC-ESXi/blob/main/rsync-3.4.1)
* Older ESXi6: [rsync v3.2.7 for ESXi](https://github.com/itiligent/RSYNC-ESXi/blob/main/rsync-3.2.7)

## ðŸ”¨ Rsync Build Script Prerequisites
#### Supported Debian Based OS:
- Debian 13 | Ubuntu 24

#### Supported Red Hat-based OS 
Any distributions with the `glibc-static` package eg:
- AlmaLinux 8, 9, 10  
- Amazon Linux 2 & 2023  
- CentOS 9 & 10  
- Fedora 41 & 42  
- OpenSUSE 15.6 & Tumbleweed  
- Oracle Linux 8, 9, 10  
- Rocky Linux 8, 9, 10  

## Building the Portable (Static) Rsync Binary

1. On a fresh supported system, run the build script **(not as root or sudo)**:

   ```bash
   ./rsync-esxi-builder-multiOS.sh
   ```
2. Copy the compiled `rsync` binary from `$HOME/build-static/rsync/bin` to **all ESXi hosts**.
3. On each ESXi host, set execute permissions on the new rsync executable:

   ```bash
   chmod 755 /path/to/rsync
   ```
4. **ESXi 8+ only** â€“ you must allow execution of non-native binaries:

   ```bash
   esxcli system settings advanced set -o /User/execInstalledOnly -i 0
   ```
5. Configure destination **RSA SSH keys** for passwordless host-to-host authentication.
   *(Note: VMware ESXi 8 does not yet support Ed25519 keys for ESXi host-to-host sessions.)*

### ðŸ’» Companion Host-2-Host Robust Replication Script

[The script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itiligent/RSYNC-ESXi/refs/heads/main/rsync-host-2-host.sh) is written in **POSIX-compliant shell** and supports replication between ESXi, BusyBox, and GNU/Linux systems.
This script provides:

* Reliable ESXi-to-ESXi | Linux-to-ESXi replication
* **Fast/Safe copy modes** for optimized transfer or reliability
* **Automatic failover and retries** on network or file errors
* **Checksum verification** for end-to-end data integrity
* **Detailed logging** for auditing and troubleshooting
* **Automatic cleanup** of orphan `rsync` processes
---

### ðŸš€ Getting started with the replication script

1. **Ensure an rsync binary is installed** on both source and destination ESXi hosts.
2. **Set up RSA SSH keys** for passwordless ssh access from the source host to the destination host.
3. Configure script options for source | destination | rsync binary paths | private key | excludes (optional) 
4. **Choose your replication mode:**

   * **FAST**: `--fast` â€“ quick copy for high bw, networked filesystems or CPU constrained (minimal verification) 
   * **SAFE**: `--safe` â€“ slower but highly resilient, verifies all transferred data, can resume copy
5. **Optional flags:**

   * `--dry-run` â†’ Test the replication without copying files
   * `--checksum` â†’ Verify file integrity after transfer
   * `--checksum-type=<algo>` â†’ Specify checksum algorithm (`xxh3`, `md5`, etc.)
   * `--no-excludes` â†’ Copy all files regardless of exclude list
6. **Run the replication script:**

   ```bash
   ./rsync-host2-host.sh --safe --checksum
   ```
7. **Monitor the logs** for progress and errors. Logs are saved with timestamps in the configured log directory.
8. **Recover from failures:**

   * FAST mode automatically falls back to SAFE mode on errors or (user configurable) timeout
   * Script will retry indefinitely (user configurable intervals) until successful
